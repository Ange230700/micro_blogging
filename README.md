Here are a number of high‑level and detailed recommendations to tighten up the architecture, remove duplication, and iron out inconsistencies across your three “authentication,” “sessions,” and “accounts” services.

---

## 1. Decouple services & eliminate shared‑DB anti‑pattern  
Right now each service’s code directly imports the other’s repository and model classes (e.g. `authentication` calls into `sessions.service.application.repositories.DjangoSessionRepository`). In a true microservice setup you’d instead:

- **Own your own data**: each service has its own database schema and never reaches into another service’s tables.  
- **Communicate via APIs or messaging**: e.g. AuthenticationService → HTTP POST `/api/sessions/add/` or publish a “session.created” event to a message bus.  
- **Extract common DTOs**: if you need to share the shape of a SessionEntity or UserEntity, define a small shared protobuf/JSON‑schema library, not a giant cross‑service import.  

---

## 2. Unify naming & package layout  
You have slight discrepancies in module paths and labels:

- In **authentication** you name your app `authentication.service` with `label="authentication_service"`, but in **sessions** it’s `sessions.service` with `label="sessions_service"`.  
- Your import paths sometimes reference `service` (e.g. `from service.application.use_cases.create_session import CreateSession`) instead of the full `sessions.service.application…`.  
- The “core” vs “application” vs “interface_adapters” layers could be aligned more rigorously across all services, so every service has:  
  ```
  ├── core/
  │   └── entities.py
  ├── application/
  │   └── use_cases/
  │   └── repositories.py  ← interface definitions
  ├── infrastructure/      ← your Django ORM adapters
  ├── interface_adapters/
  │   ├── controllers.py
  │   └── presenters.py
  └── models.py            ← Django models
  ```  

---

## 3. DRY up duplicated SessionEntity & logic  
You define `SessionEntity` and the entire `CreateSession` use case twice (once in `authentication/service` and again in `sessions/service`). Better to centralize:

- Keep the **authoritative** SessionEntity, CreateSession, GetSession, DeleteSession, RefreshToken use cases in the **Sessions** service.  
- In **Authentication**, simply call out to the Sessions service’s HTTP endpoint or shared library—don’t re‑implement the same class twice.  

---

## 4. Centralize JWT & Cookie‐JWT logic  
You have two slightly different token‐refresh controllers (`CookieTokenRefreshView` in sessions, plus `RefreshTokenController` under “refresh_token_controller.py”). Pick one pattern:

- **Single refresh endpoint** that reads the refresh cookie → blacklists old token → issues new access token cookie.  
- If you need both an internal and external API, share a **common base class** for Cookie reading/writing, rather than copy‑pasting.  

Also, consider factoring all JWT settings (lifetimes, signing algorithm, `USER_ID_CLAIM`, etc.) into a shared config utility so that **every** service uses the exact same values.

---

## 5. Improve settings & environment handling  
- You load `.env` in each service’s settings.py; if you ever deploy all three behind one process, this will clash. Instead, use a **common base settings** module that each service can import & override.  
- Your `TIME_ZONE` is set to `"UTC"`, but the user is Europe/Paris—if that matters, centralize on one zone or make it configurable per service.  
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` are both parsed from a comma‑separated env var; consider validating and defaulting to a safe list.

---

## 6. Clean up URL inclusion mistakes  
In `authentication/config/urls.py` you do:

```python
path("api/auth/", include("service.views")),
```

but your views live under `authentication/service/views.py`. Update to:

```python
path("api/auth/", include("authentication.service.views"))
```

and likewise for the other two services, to avoid Django “No module named 'service'” errors.

---

## 7. Consolidate error handling & response structure  
- Every presenter (`LoginPresenter`, `RegisterPresenter`, `AccountPresenter`, `SessionPresenter`) formats JSON slightly differently. Standardize on a common envelope:

  ```json
  {
    "status": "success" | "error",
    "data": { … },
    "error": { "code": "...", "message": "…" }
  }
  ```

- This makes it far easier for clients to handle responses uniformly.

---

## 8. Leverage Django’s AppConfig & dependency injection  
Right now your controllers manually instantiate repositories:

```python
session_repository = DjangoSessionRepository()
use_case = CreateSession(session_repository)
```

Consider using a lightweight DI container (or at least factory functions in your AppConfig) so you can swap out the repository implementation for testing or for an in‑memory stub.

---

## 9. Remove stale/commented‑out code & unify imports  
- There are a few repeated `# pylint: disable=no-member` directives—once you get your imports right, you can remove those.  
- Clean up trailing comment blocks, ensure all modules actually exist (e.g. `authentication.service.authentication.CookieJWTAuthentication` is mentioned in settings but not defined in your snippet).

---

## 10. Elevate cross‑cutting concerns to middleware  
- **Cookie → JWT** translation, blacklisting, and refresh could live in a custom middleware rather than in every controller.  
- If you have audit logging or metrics, capture them in middleware or DRF’s native hooks.

---

### In summary  
- **Decouple**: no more “import my sibling service’s ORM.”  
- **DRY & centralize**: shared entities, shared JWT logic, shared settings.  
- **Standardize**: naming, package layout, response envelopes.  
- **Simplify**: remove duplicate classes (CreateSession, SessionEntity, etc.), pick one refresh flow.  
- **Clean up**: URL includes, import paths, commented‑out code.

Adopting these changes will give you a **more modular**, **testable**, and **maintainable** architecture. Let me know if you’d like code examples or a concrete refactoring of one of the services!
